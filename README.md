This is a simple Python 3 code designed to make it a bit easier to visualise hypercubes.

Requirements:
- Python 3
- PyQt5
- Numpy
- Matplotlib

To run this code, one must update lines 20, 21 and 22 (default wavelengths, reference spectra for the calibrated macbeth colour patches and the corresponding rgb values).
The code expects the hypercube and the wavelengths to be in the npz format.
